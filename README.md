# Bilingual Comparable Corpora Clustering

This repository provides the source code for the models and baselines described in the paper  _A Closer Look at Clustering Bilingual Comparable Corpora_ by Anna Laskina, Eric Gaussier, Gaelle Calvary and accepted at LREC-COLING 2024.

**Abstract**: We study in this paper the problem of clustering comparable corpora, building upon the observation that different types of clusters can be present in such corpora: monolingual clusters comprising documents in a single language, and bilingual or multilingual clusters comprising documents written in different languages. Based on a state-of-the-art deep variant of Kmeans, we propose new clustering models fully adapted to comparable corpora and illustrate their behavior on several bilingual collections (in English, French, German and Russian) created from Wikipedia.
